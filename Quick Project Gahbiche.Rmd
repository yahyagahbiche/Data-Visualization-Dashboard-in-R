Waste reduction: Packaging  
=========================================

<div style="float: left; width: 75%;">


</div>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

![](Most orders contain 2 and 3 items per order.png){width=600px}



+ Waste can be in the form of extra packaging or unefficient usage of labor and equipment. 

+ Here we see that most customers order 2 or 3 items in one order. 
+ In order to reduce waste we must have more items per order.


<br> 

</div>


Changing Shipping mode can save us time
=========================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">




![](Standard shipping orders have a high cost associated with them.png){width=600px}


+ Same Day shipping does't cost a lot compared to Standard Shipping 

+ Costs from Standard shipping can be reduced. 

+ We can advertise more for Same Day shipping to reduce waste (time)


<br> 

</div>


New York City is where we should focus our marketing efforts
===========================================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">



![](New York City is leading in total profits.png){width=400px} 



+ It is evident that NYC is ahead of all other big cities in the US.

+ Sales in NYC are over **$60,000.**

+ philadelphia had a lot of sales volume but a lot of losses. 

  - We need to look into why Philadelphia has all these losses

<br> 

</div>


We need to stop selling to Philadelphia
========================================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">


![](Philadelphia Annual profit.png){width=400px} 


+ We can clearly see how Philadelphia has been losing money in the past year

+ It had also recorded a large loss before the end of **2014**



<br> 

</div>


To wrap-up 
========================================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">


+ To reduce waste we need to advertise for more items per order.
  
    - This can be done for example by combining items going to the same address and shipping them on one particluar day.
    
    - This can be a membership program that customers can sign up for to benefit from the premium service.
    
+ Focus more on quick shipping: Same Day and First Class. 

    - This will:
    
        - Reduce waste: Time
        - Increase customer satisfaction

+ We must focus on generating profit from NYC as it is the leader in sales number and profit.
